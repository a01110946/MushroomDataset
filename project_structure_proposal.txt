Explanation of the project structure:

1. The `configs` directory contains the configuration files for the models and training hyperparameters.
2. The `data` directory is structured into subdirectories for raw, external, interim, and processed data.
3. The `docs` directory includes the data dictionary, model documentation, and final project report.
4. The `models` directory stores the trained and serialized models, including the baseline model and the best model artifacts.
5. The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling experiments, and model evaluation.
6. The `references` directory includes data dictionaries, manuals, and other explanatory materials.
7. The `reports` directory is used for generated analysis reports and figures.
8. The `src` directory contains the main source code for the project, organized into subdirectories:
    - `data`: Scripts for data ingestion, preprocessing, and splitting.
    - `features`: Scripts for feature engineering.
    - `models`: Scripts for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
    - `monitoring`: Scripts for data drift detection and model performance monitoring.
    - `api`: FastAPI application and endpoint scripts.
    - `utils`: Utility scripts for configuration, logging, and path management.
9. The `tests` directory contains test scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
10. The `.github` directory includes GitHub Actions workflows for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
11. The `Dockerfile` is used for containerizing the application.

This project structure organizes the code and resources in a modular and scalable way, separating concerns and making it easier to maintain and extend the project. It also incorporates the necessary components for productionalization, such as MLflow for experiment tracking and model management, FastAPI for serving the model, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and containerization with Docker.

Remember to update the `README.md` file with instructions on how to set up and run the project, including the necessary dependencies and environment setup.
