# Test cases

Absolutely! Let's tackle each test case one by one and develop comprehensive tests to ensure maximum coverage. We'll aim for over 95% coverage and leave no stone unturned. Let's start with the first test case and work our way through the list.

1. Invalid input data:
   a. Test with missing required fields:
      - Create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint with missing required fields in the input data.
      - Assert that the response status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the missing fields.
      - Repeat this test for each required field, removing one field at a time to ensure all required fields are validated.

   b. Test with invalid data types:
      - Create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint with invalid data types for each field (e.g., string instead of float).
      - Assert that the response status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the invalid data type.
      - Repeat this test for each field, using different invalid data types to ensure proper validation.

   c. Test with out-of-range values:
      - Create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint with out-of-range values for each numeric field.
      - Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK) and the response contains a prediction, as the model should handle out-of-range values gracefully.
      - Repeat this test for different out-of-range values (e.g., negative numbers, extremely large numbers) to ensure the model's robustness.

2. Model and preprocessor loading:
   a. Test with missing model or preprocessor files:
      - Temporarily rename or remove the model or preprocessor files.
      - Create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint.
      - Assert that the response status code is 500 (Internal Server Error) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the missing files.
      - Restore the model and preprocessor files after the test.

   b. Test with corrupted or incompatible model files:
      - Create a corrupted or incompatible model file (e.g., by modifying the file contents or using a different scikit-learn version).
      - Create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint.
      - Assert that the response status code is 500 (Internal Server Error) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the issue with the model file.

   b. Test with missing or invalid request payloads:
      - Create a test function that sends a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with an empty request payload.
      - Assert that the response status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the missing payload.
      - Create another test function that sends a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with an invalid request payload (e.g., missing required fields, invalid JSON format).
      - Assert that the response status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the invalid payload.

   c. Test with unauthorized access attempts:
      - If your API requires authentication (e.g., API key, JWT token), create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint without the required authentication.
      - Assert that the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the missing authentication.
      - If your API uses role-based access control, create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint with a valid authentication token but insufficient permissions.
      - Assert that the response status code is 403 (Forbidden) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the lack of permissions.

4. Preprocessing and prediction:
   a. Test with input data that doesn't match the expected format:

      - Assert that the response status code is 422 (Unprocessable Entity) and the response contains an appropriate error message indicating the issue with the input data format.
      - Repeat this test for different variations of input data format mismatches to ensure proper validation.

   b. Test with input data that contains unseen categorical values:
      - Create a test function that sends a request to the `/predict` endpoint with input data containing unseen categorical values (i.e., values not present in the training data).
      - Assert that the response status code is 200 (OK) and the response contains a prediction, as the model should handle unseen categorical values gracefully.
      - Repeat this test for different unseen categorical values to ensure the model's robustness.

Remember to organize the tests in a structured manner, using descriptive test function names and grouping related tests together. Use pytest fixtures and parameterization to reduce code duplication and improve test maintainability.

Additionally, ensure that the tests are automated and integrated into your CI/CD pipeline, so they are executed on every code change or deployment.

By covering these test cases thoroughly, you'll have a robust test suite that helps ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to provide more detailed examples for specific test cases!
